        <p>Elend Venture is a character who appears in Brandon Sanderson's first Mistborn trilogy. Born a nobleman to House
            Venture by Straff Venture, Elend is considered an inept socialite at noble functions, as he exhibits the habit
            of reading during balls to upset his father and an unusual fixation on the lower class people of The Final Empire
            known as skaa. He considers himself to be a knowledgeable scholar. </p>
        <p>Alongside Vin and the remnants of Kelsier's crew, he forms the New Empire and helps to save to world from its destruction
            at Ruin's hands by uniting as many people as possible, using Seers to burn the vast atium cache known as the
            Trust, and allowing Marsh to kill him during the Battle of Hathsin, giving Vin the drive to kill Ruin.</p>
